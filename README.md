## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Upon completing this project I have demonstrated my understanding of what I have learned via the HTML & CSS foundations courses on The Odin Project. I continued to build on this basic website as I progressed in the course using CSS grid, flexbox, and responsive web design.

### Continued development

I plan to continue practicing responsive design as well as my HTML/CSS skills.
